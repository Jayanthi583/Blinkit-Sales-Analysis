Approach & Methodology
This end-to-end data analytics project involved a comprehensive pipeline to transform raw sales data into strategic business intelligence:

Data Acquisition & Preparation:
Structured data was extracted from a MySQL database.
Extensive data cleaning and transformation were performed using Excel Power Query to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Leveraged Python with libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to conduct in-depth EDA.
Applied various statistical techniques including descriptive statistics, groupby aggregations, correlation analysis, and outlier detection (using boxplots) to reveal underlying sales patterns and trends.
Analyzed performance across critical business dimensions, including Item Fat Content, Item Type, Outlet Size, and Establishment Type, alongside geographic trends.

Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Analysis:
Defined and tracked essential sales-related KPIs, including Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items Sold, and Average Product Rating, examining their variations across different outlet types and locations.
